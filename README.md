Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the sytematic application of engineering principles, methords and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software which usually involves testing, deplloyment and maintainence of software products

importance of software enginnering include - creation of software applications
                                            - creation of systems that power various aspect of modern life
                                            
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
advert of structured programming which  happened in 1970s
establishment of software engineering as a discipline which prometes the study the discippline as a discipline in 1960s
development of programming languages such as fortran
the rise of methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - is basically gathering users needs and system requirements
Design - is the creation of hight level user-interface and software achitecture
implementation - involves writing of the code
Testing - is the process of making sure it meeets quality standard by doing various tests
Deployment - is the aspect of releasing the software to the users
Maintenance - this stage is where-by you provide ongoing support

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential approach that follows, requirement, design , implementation,testing and deployment, maintenance whereas Agile methedology emphsizes on iterative development collaboration and software feedback

agile methodology web-based-commerce platform where users needs  and maerket trends are constantly changing  while Waterfall  developing a  embeded software for medical where strict regulatory compliance and predictable performance are paramount.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensure software quality by design and test plans
System Architecture - design overall structure and architecture of a software system.
UserInterface and UservExperince designers - create user interface and user experience of the software application

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
increase code completion and suggetions like visual studios
debugging IDEs provides powerful debuggers editors, inspect variables, identify and fix bugs
intelliJ IDEA known for its intelligent code comopletion and extensive plugin systems

VSCs allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simulataneously
VSCS can be intergrated by bug tracking systems
VSCS provides reliable back-up of the codebase ensuring changes are not lost

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing reuirements which could lead to scope creep  the effective strategy to overcome this is effective communication
Tight deadlines you should be agile to cope with this challenges by applying agile methodologies
techncal debt - this can be avoideded by regular reassesment of project goals and timeline

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components. importance early etection of defects like bnugs
Intergration testing - testing iteration between diffrent components. importance interface verification chacks that data and contarol flow between modules
System testing - testing entire software system. importance reuiremnt validation bby verifying that the system meets the functional and non-funtional requirements.
Acceptance testing  - testing the software against user requirement. importance ensures taht the system meets the expectations of the extended user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of iterating a generalise AI prompt to improves the accuracy by crafting inputs and guiding AI behavior by proces of designing  and refining the text inputs.

importance  - enhance output quality
             -improve control and customization
             -mmitigation of bias and errors
             -increase efficiency and productivity
             -bridging the human AI gap


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example of vague prompt - "Discuss history"
example of improved promp - " Discus the history of Nelson Mandela"
the improved is more efective cause its precise and has a subject matter to what is to be discussed.
